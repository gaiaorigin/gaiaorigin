		<description lang="en">Orion is a system for caching search and scraping results for later reuse. Metadata and links on Orion are maintained by the community. Searches are cached so that subsequent users can quickly access the results without having to go through a lengthy scraping process themselves. The Orion Kodi addon does not provide any search or playback features, but it can easily be integrated into any other addon, website, or standalone program with minimal effort.</description>
		<disclaimer lang="en">Orion does not create, host, or distribute any files or videos. Orion is a caching service providing low-level API access to a community-maintained storage of textual data. All metadata and links available through Orion are scraped, processed, and submitted by community users. Due to the volume, velocity, and complexity of the data, Orion cannot inspect or validate the content submitted by users. Data on Orion may therefore be inaccurate, out-dated, or in other ways unusable. Orion does not guarantee the validity or integrity of the data available through its API and does not take liability for any of the data submitted by its users. Users take the risk and are responsible for the manner in which they utilize the Orion API.</disclaimer>
